## v0.1.11

This version was released on July 29, 2022.

### Main changes

#### SQL features

* New SQL functions:
    * `overlay()`: Replaces a substring. [#3671](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3671)

    * `string_agg ()`: Concatenates the values into a string. [#3952](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3952) [#4183](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4183)
    * `current_database()`: Returns the current database.  [#3650](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3650)
* New SQL commands:
    * `SHOW ALL`: Lists all configuration parameters. Use `SHOW parameter` to show the value of a configuration parameter. [#3694](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3694) [#3664](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3664)

    * `EXPLAIN TRACE`: Traces each optimization stage of the optimizer. [#3945](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3945)

[#3859](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3859) [#3763](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3763)
* An `ORDER BY` clause in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement is allowed but not considered as part of the definition of the materialized view. It is only used in the initial creation of the materialized view. It is not used during refreshes. This is a behavior change due to the introduction of parallel table scans. [#3670](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3670)
* Support for filter clauses on aggregate functions. [#4114](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/4114)

* Syntax change for `CREATE SOURCE`: A parameter name is no longer wrapped by single quotation marks. [#3997](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave/pull/3997). See the example:
    * Old: `CREATE SOURCE s1 WITH ( 'connector' = 'kafka', 'kafka.topic' = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', 'kafka.brokers' = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`  
    * New: `CREATE SOURCE s WITH ( connector = 'kafka', kafka.topic = 'kafka_1_partition_topic', kafka.brokers = '127.0.0.1:29092' ) ROW FORMAT json;`
