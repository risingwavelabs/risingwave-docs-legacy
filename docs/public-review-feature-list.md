This topic lists all features in the public review phase.

### RisingWave feature lifecycle

In RisingWave, the release of a feature typically follows three main stages:

1. **Internal review**: This is the initial testing phase after a feature is developed, restricted to internal teams. The purpose of this phase is to conduct feature testing and make necessary adjustments. Documentation is generally not provided at this stage.

2. **Public preview**: Before a feature becomes generally available (GA), it enters the public preview phase. During this phase, the feature is made accessible to all users to gather broader feedback. Corresponding guides are provided in the official documentation, and the feature is marked with a “Public Review Phase” note.

3. **General availability (GA)**: After thorough testing and validation, the feature progresses to the GA stage, becoming a stable part of the product. At this point, the “Public Review Phase” note is removed.

Therefore, when you see a “Public Review Phase” in the documentation, it indicates that the feature has not yet achieved 100% stability. We recommend evaluating the feature according to your specific use case. If you encounter any issues with the feature, please contact us via our [Slack channel](https://www.risingwave.com/slack). We also welcome any of your feedback to help us improve it.
