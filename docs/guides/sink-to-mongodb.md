This guide describes how to sink data from RisingWave to MongoDB. MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of application development and scaling. For more information, see [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='mongodb',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter Name**              | **Description**    |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| `mongodb.url`                   | The URL of MongoDB.  |
| `type`                        | Defines the type of the sink. Options include `append-only` or `upsert`.  |
| `collection.name`               | The collection name where data should be written to or read from. For sinks, the format is `db_name.collection_name`. Data can also be written to dynamic collections; see `collection.name.field` below for more information.   |
| `collection.name.field`         | Optional. The dynamic collection name where data should be sunk to. If specified, the field value will be used as the collection name. The collection name format is the same as `collection.name`. If the field value is null or an empty string, then the `collection.name` will be used as a fallback destination.        |
| `collection.name.field.drop`    | Optional. Controls whether the field value of `collection.name.field` should be dropped when sinking. Set this option to `true` to avoid the duplicate values of `collection.name.field` being written to the result collection.  |
| `mongodb.bulk_write.max_entries` | Optional. The maximum entries that will accumulate before performing the bulk write. Defaults to 1024. Default value is `1024`.  |

## Examples

Below are some use cases for your reference.

### Sink data with append-only

To create a sink with the append-only type:

```sql
CREATE sink t1_sink FROM t1
WITH (
    connector='mongodb',
    type = 'append-only',
    mongodb.url = 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
    collection.name = 'demo.t1'
);
```

In append-only mode, MongoDB will automatically generate an `_id` field for each record, typically with a value of the [`ObjectId`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/) type. This is necessary because `_id` is the primary key in MongoDB.

### Sink data with upsert

To create a sink with the upsert type for a table with a single key:

```sql title="single key"
CREATE sink t2_sink FROM t2
WITH (
    connector='mongodb',
    type = 'upsert',
    mongodb.url = 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
    collection.name = 'demo.t2',
    primary_key='id'
);
```

Assuming the schema of `t2` is:
| name  | type | pk  |
|-------|------|-----|
| id    | int  | âœ”   |
| value | text |     |

Given the record:
| id | value   |
|----|---------|
| 1  | 'example of record' |

The record written to MongoDB will be:

```json
{ "_id": 1, "id": 1, "value": "example of record" }
```

:::note
No redundant `id` field will exist if the primary key of `t2` is `_id`.
:::

To create a sink with the upsert type for a table with a compound key:

```sql title="compound key"
CREATE TABLE t3(
    a int,
    b int,
    value text,
    primary key (a, b)
);

insert into t3 values(1, 2, 'abc');

CREATE sink t3_sink FROM t3
WITH (
    connector='mongodb',
    type = 'upsert',
    mongodb.url = 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
    collection.name = 'demo.t3',
    primary_key='a,b'
);
```

The record written to MongoDB will be:

```json
{ "_id": { "a": 1, "b": 2 }, "a": 1, "b": 2, "value": "abc" }
```

### Dynamic collection name

Dynamic collection names are useful in certain scenarios. For example, a multi-tenant application may store its data using sharding, where `tenant_id` is included as a prefix in the collection name, such as `sharding_2024_01.tenant1_order`. This approach offers more flexibility and enables efficient data organization and retrieval based on specific tenant requirements.

To use a dynamic collection name:

```sql
CREATE sink t2_sink FROM t2
WITH (
    connector='mongodb',
    type = 'upsert',
    mongodb.url = 'mongodb://mongodb:27017/?replicaSet=rs0',
    collection.name = 'demo.t2',
    collection.name.field = 'collection_name',
    collection.name.field.drop = 'true',
    primary_key='_id'
);
```

- `collection.name`: Serve as a fallback collection name if the value of `collection.name.field` is empty or null. In this case, it defaults to `demo.t2`.

- `collection.name.field`: Specify the field used for the collection name. This field must be of type `varchar`.

- `collection.name.field.drop`: When set to `true`, it avoids duplicate values of `collection.name.field` in the result collection.
