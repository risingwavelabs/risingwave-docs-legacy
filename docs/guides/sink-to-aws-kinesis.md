This topic described how to sink data from RisingWave to AWS Kinesis Data Streams.

:::caution Experimental feature
The AWS Kinesis sink connector in RisingWave is currently an experimental feature. Its functionality is subject to change. We cannot guarantee its continued support in future releases, and it may be discontinued without notice. You may use this feature at your own risk.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name
[FROM sink_from | AS select_query]
WITH (
   connector='kinesis',
   connector_parameter = 'value', ...
);
```

## Basic parameters

|Field|Notes|
|-----|-----|
|stream |Required. Name of the stream.|
|aws.region |Required. AWS service region. For example, US East (N. Virginia).|
|endpoint |Optional. URL of the entry point for the AWS Kinesis service.|
|aws.credentials.access_key_id |Conditional. This field indicates the access key ID of AWS. It must appear in pairs with `aws.credentials.secret_access_key`. |
|aws.credentials.secret_access_key |Conditional. This field indicates the secret access key of AWS. It must appear in pairs with `aws.credentials.access_key_id`. |
|aws.credentials.session_token |Optional. The session token associated with the temporary security credentials. |
|aws.credentials.role.arn |Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.|
|aws.credentials.role.external_id|Optional. The [external id](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-external-id-when-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources/) used to authorize access to third-party resources. |

## Sink parameters

|Field|Notes|
|-----|-----|
|type|Data format. Allowed formats:<ul><li> `append-only`: Output data with insert operations.</li><li> `debezium`: Output change data capture (CDC) log in Debezium format.</li><li> `upsert`: Output data as a changelog stream. `primary_key` must be specified in this case. </li></ul> To learn about when to define the primary key if creating an `upsert` sink, see the [Overview](/data-delivery.md).|
|force_append_only| If `true`, forces the sink to be `append-only`, even if it cannot be.|
|primary_key| The primary keys of the sink. Use ',' to delimit the primary key columns. If the external sink has its own primary key, this field should not be specified.|

## Examples

```sql
CREATE SINK s1 FROM t WITH (
 connector = 'kinesis',
 stream = 'kinesis-sink-demo',
 aws.region = 'us-east-1',
 aws.credentials.access_key_id = 'your_access_key',
 aws.credentials.secret_access_key = 'your_secret_key',
 type = 'debezium');
```
