## What are runtime parameters?

Runtime parameters are variables that can be set at runtime to configure the behavior of RisingWave.

## How to view runtime parameters?

You can use the `SHOW ALL` command to view the runtime parameters, their current settings, and some notes about these parameters.

```sql
SHOW ALL;
```

For example, you may see a table similar to this:


```plain text title="Runtime Parameters"
          Name                  |     Setting     |        Description
--------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------
 rw_implicit_flush              | false           | If `RW_IMPLICIT_FLUSH` is on, then every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statement will block until the entire dataflow is refreshed.
 create_compaction_group_for_mv | false           | If `CREATE_COMPACTION_GROUP_FOR_MV` is on, dedicated compaction groups will be created in MV creation.
 query_mode                     | auto            | A temporary config variable to force query running in either local or distributed mode. If the value is auto, the system will decide for you automatically.
 ...
```

Below is the detailed information about the parameters you may see after using the `SHOW ALL` command:

|                 Name                  |     Values or value examples     |                                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                                     |

See Section 8.4 for more information. The bytea type always accepts both formats on input, regardless of this setting. |


If you just want to view a specific parameter's value, you can also use the `SHOW` command.

```sql
SHOW parameter_name;
```

## How to configure runtime parameters?

You can use `SET` command or the `set_config()` function to change the setting of a runtime parameter.

The syntax of the `SET` command is:

```sql
SET parameter_name { TO | = } { value | 'value' | DEFAULT};
```

Where `parameter_name` is the name of the parameter, and `value` or `'value'` is the new value of the parameter. `DEFAULT` can be written to specify resetting the parameter to its default value.

For details about the `set_config()` function, see [System administration functions](/sql/functions-operators/sql-function-sys-admin.md#set_config), and for details about the `SET` command, see [`SET`](/sql/commands/sql-set.md).


You can also use the [`ALTER SYSTEM SET`](/sql/commands/sql-alter-system.md) command to set a system-wide default value for a runtime parameter. This configuration will then be applied to every new session.

```sql title="Syntax"
ALTER SYSTEM SET session_param_name TO session_param_value;
```
