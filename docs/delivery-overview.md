RisingWave supports delivering data to message brokers and databases.

Before you stream data out of RisingWave, you need to create a sink first. A sink is an external target that you can send data to. Use a [`CREATE SINK`](./sql/commands/sql-create-sink.md) statement to create a sink. You need to specify what data to be exported, the format, as well as the sink parameters.
