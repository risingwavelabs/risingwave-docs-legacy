## UNION and UNION ALL

The UNION operator combines the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements and removes duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.

The UNION ALL operator combines the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements and returns all rows from the query. It does not remove duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements.

Each SELECT statement within the UNION operator must have the same number of fields in the result sets with similar data types.

The syntax for the `UNION ALL` operator is as follows:

```sql
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
UNION ALL
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions];
```

*expression1, expression2, ... expression_n* are the columns or calculations you wish to retrieve.

*tables* are the tables that you wish to retrieve records from. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.

*WHERE conditions* are optional. These conditions must be met for the records to be selected.



Suppose that we have a table, "points_scored_current_week", that consists of these columns: `id`, `first_half`, and `second_half`.

|  id   |first_half|second_half|
|-------|----------|-----------|
|   1   |   10     |    20     |


Next, suppose that we have a second table, "points_scored_last_week", that consists of these columns: `id`, `first_half`, and `second_half`.

|  id   |first_half|second_half|
|-------|----------|-----------|
|   1   |   10     |    20     |



Here is an example that uses the UNION operator:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM points_scored_current_week 
UNION
SELECT * 
FROM points_scored_last_week;
```


The result looks like this: 

```
first_half|second_half
----------+-----------+
10        | 20
```

Here is an example that uses the UNION ALL operator:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM points_scored_current_week 
UNION ALL 
SELECT * 
FROM points_scored_last_week;
```


The result looks like this: 

```
first_half|second_half
----------+-----------+
10        | 20
10        | 20
```


:::note

UNION and UNION ALL operator are both supported for streaming queries.
