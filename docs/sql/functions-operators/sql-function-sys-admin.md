This page lists both RisingWave system administration functions and PostgreSQL system administration functions that are supported in RisingWave.

## `current_setting()`

Returns the current value of a specified runtime parameter. This function corresponds to the SQL command `SHOW`.

```sql title=Example
SELECT current_setting ('server_version');
---------RESULT
 current_setting 
-----------------
 8.3.0
(1 row)
```

You can use the `SHOW ALL` command to get the complete list of runtime parameters and corresponding descriptions.

## `has_table_privilege`

Checks if a user has access to a table in a specific way. You can identify the user by their name, their OID (pg_authid.oid), or by using `public` to refer to the PUBLIC pseudo-role. If no argument is provided, it assumes the current user.

To specify the table, you can use its name or OID. If needed, you can schema-qualify the table name.

The desired access privilege type is specified as a text string. It must be one of the following values: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, or TRIGGER. You can also add WITH GRANT OPTION to test if the privilege is held with the grant option. If you want to check for multiple privilege types, you can list them separated by commas. The result will be true if any of the listed privileges is held. The case of the privilege string is not important, and you can have extra whitespace between privilege names, but not within them.

```sql title="Syntax"
has_table_privilege([user,] table, privilege) -> boolean
```

```sql title="Example"
SELECT has_table_privilege('test_user', 'foo', 'SELECT');
----RESULT
t
```

## `has_schema_privilege`

Checks if a user has access to a schema in a specific way. It has similar argument possibilities as the `has_table_privilege` function.

The desired access privilege type should be a combination of CREATE and/or USAGE, such as "CREATE, USAGE", or just a single privilege type like "CREATE" or "USAGE".

```sql title="Syntax"
has_schema_privilege([user,] schema, privilege) -> boolean
```

```sql title="Example"
SELECT has_schema_privilege('test_user', 'test_schema', 'CREATE');
----RESULT
t
```

## `has_any_column_privilege`

Checks if a user has access to any column of a table in a specific way. It has similar argument possibilities as the `has_table_privilege` function, but with a few differences.

The desired access privilege type should evaluate to a combination of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or REFERENCES. This means that the privilege type can be a combination of these four, such as "SELECT, INSERT", or just a single privilege type like "UPDATE".

It's important to note that when a user has any of these privileges at the table level, it automatically grants them for each column of the table. Therefore, if the "has_table_privilege" function returns true for the same arguments, the "has_any_column_privilege" function will also return true. However, the "has_any_column_privilege" function will also succeed if there is a column-level grant of the privilege for at least one column.

```sql title="Syntax"
has_any_column_privilege([user,] table, privilege) -> boolean
```

```sql title="Example"
SELECT has_any_column_privilege('test_user', 'foo_view'::regclass, 'INSERT');
----RESULT
f
```

## `set_config()`

```sql title="Syntax"
set_config ( setting_name text, new_value text, is_local boolean ) â†’ text
```

Sets the parameter `setting_name` to `new_value`, and returns that value. If `is_local` is `true`, the new value will only apply during the current transaction. If you want the new value to apply for the rest of the current session, use `false` instead. This function corresponds to the SQL command [`SET`](/sql/commands/sql-set.md).

```sql title="Example"
SELECT set_config('rw_implicit_flush', 'true', false);
-------
true
```

<!--
## `pg_terminate_backend()`

Terminates a backend. You can execute this against another backend that has exactly the same role as the user calling the function. In all other cases, you must be a superuser. For more details, see [System Administration Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html).

## `pg_backend_pid()`

Returns the ID of the server process attached to the current session. For more details, see [System Information Functions and Operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-info.html).

## `pg_cancel_backend()`

Cancels a backend's current query. You can execute this against another backend that has exactly the same role as the user calling the function. In all other cases, you must be a superuser. For more details, see [System Administration Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html). -->

## `pg_indexes_size('table_name')`

Returns the total size of all indexes associated with a particular table in bytes.

```sql title=Example
SELECT pg_indexes_size('t1');
---------RESULT
 pg_indexes_size 
-----------------
               0
(1 row)
```

## `pg_table_size('table_name')`

Returns the size of a table in bytes.

```sql title=Example
SELECT pg_table_size('t1');
---------RESULT
 pg_table_size 
---------------
           240
(1 row)
```

## `pg_stat_get_numscans('table_name')`

Returns the total number of scans (sequential and index scans) performed on a specified table since the server was started.

```sql title=Example
SELECT pg_stat_get_numscans('my_table');
 pg_stat_get_numscans 
----------------------
                    0
(1 row)
```
