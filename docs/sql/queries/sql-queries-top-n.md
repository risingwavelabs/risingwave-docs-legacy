title: Top-N
---

Top-N queries provide the N largest or smallest values ordered by columns. Top-N queries are helpful to display only the N top-most or the N bottom-most records.

Syntax of the Top-N statement:
```sql
SELECT [column_list] 
  FROM (
    SELECT [column_list], 
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER ([PARTITION BY col1[, col2...]] 
        ORDER BY col1 [asc|desc][, col2 [asc|desc]...]) AS rank 
    FROM table_name)
WHERE rank <= N [AND conditions];
```

:::note

`rank` cannot be included in `column_list`.
