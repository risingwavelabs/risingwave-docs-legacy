Use the `SELECT` command to retrieve rows from a table or materialized view. It returns the rows that satisfy the creteria that you specify with the clauses and conditions in your query.


```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT] [ * | <expression> [ AS <output_name> ] [, <expression> [ AS <output_name> ]...] ]
    [ FROM <from_item> [, <from_item> ...] ]
    [ WHERE <condition> ]
    [ GROUP BY <grouping_expression> [, <grouping_expression>... ]
    [ HAVING <condition> ]
    [ ORDER BY <ordering_expression> [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...] ]
    [ LIMIT { count | ALL } ]
    [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
```
Where `from_item` can be:
```sql
    <table>  [ [ AS ] <alias> [ ( <column_alias_list> ) ]]
    <window_type> (<table>, <col>, <interval_expression>) [ [ AS ] <alias> [ ( <column_alias_list> ) ] ] 
    (<select>) [ [ AS ] <alias> [ ( <column_alias_list> ) ] ] 
    <from_item>  <join_type> <from_item> [ ON <join_condition> ]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter / Clause         | Description and usage|
|---------------------------|----------------------|
|*expression*               |A column or an expression.|
|*alias*                    |A temporary alternative name for a table or materialized view in a query.|
|*table*                    |A table or materialized view|
|*ordering_expression*      ï½œ<ul><li>Output column names</li><li>Output column ordinal numbers</li><li>Hidden select expressions</li></ul>|
|**LIMIT** clause           | When the ORDER BY clause is not present, the LIMIT clause cannot be used as part of a materialized view. |
|**OFFSET** clause          |The OFFSET clause can only be used with the LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses.|
|*select*                   |A SELECT command. You must enclose the subquery in parentheses, and specify an alias. When you include a subquery in the FROM clause, the output of the subquery is used as a temporary view that is only valid in the query.|
|*join_type*                |<p>The values can be:</p> <ul><li>[INNER] JOIN</li><li>LEFT [OUTER] JOIN</li><li>RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN</li><li>FULL [OUTER] JOIN</li></ul><p>Currently, only the ON clause is supported for joins.</p>|
|*join_condition*           |Conditions for the ON clause that must be met before the two from_items can be joined.|
|*window_type*              |The type of the time window function. Possible values are `HOP` and `TUMBLE`.|
|*interval_expression*      |The interval expression, in the format of `INTERVAL '<interval>'`. For example: `INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'`. The standard SQL format, which places time units outside of quotation marks (for example, `INTERVAL '2' MINUTES`), is also supported. |


### expression

A column or an expression.

### alias

An alias is a temporary alternative name for columns, tables, views, materialized views, etc. in a query.

### table

The name of a table or materialized view.

### grouping_expression

- Input column names
- Input column expressions without subqueries or correlated columns


### ordering_expression

The values can be:
- Output column names
- Output column ordinal numbers
- Hidden select expressions

### LIMIT clause

This clause returns a subset of the rows.

- `count`: Returns the specified number of rows at maximum.
- **ALL**: Returns all rows.

When the ORDER BY clause is not present, the LIMIT clause cannot be used as part of a materialized view.

### OFFSET clause

The OFFSET clause can only be used with the LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses.

### select

A SELECT command. You must enclose the subquery in parentheses, and specify an alias.
When you include a subquery in the FROM clause, the output of the subquery is used as a temporary view that is only valid in the query.

### join_type

The values can be: 
- [INNER] JOIN
- LEFT [OUTER] JOIN
- RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN
- FULL [OUTER] JOIN

Currently, only the ON clause is supported for joins.

### join_condition

Conditions for the ON clause that must be met before the two from_items can be joined.

### window_type

The type of the time window function. Possible values are `HOP` and `TUMBLE`.

### interval_expression

The interval expression, in the format of `INTERVAL '<count>' <timeunit>`. For example: `INTERVAL '1' DAYS`.
