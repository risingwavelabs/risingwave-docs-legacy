            rr.Terminal('DELETE'),
            rr.Terminal('FROM'),
            rr.NonTerminal('table_name', 'skip'),
        ),

## Parameters

|Parameter or clause        | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|*table_name*               |The table where you want to remove records.|
|**WHERE** *condition*      |Specify which rows you want to remove using an expression that returns a boolean value. Rows for which this expression returns true will be removed. <br/> If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows of records in the table will be deleted but the table structure will be kept.|
|**RETURNING**               |Returns the values of any column based on each deleted row.|


## Example

The `taxi_trips` table has three records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM taxi_trips;
```
```
 id | distance |    city     
----+----------+-------------
  1 |       16 | Yerba Buena
  2 |       23 | New York
  3 |        6 | Chicago
(3 rows)
```

The following statement removes the record with id 3 from the table. Also, it returns the value of *id* for the deleted row.

```sql
DELETE FROM taxi_trips 
WHERE id = 3 
RETURNING id;
```

The following statement removes all rows from the table. 

```sql
DELETE FROM taxi_trips 
```

Let's see the result.

```sql
SELECT * FROM taxi_trips;
```
```
 id | distance | city 
----+----------+------
(0 rows)
```
