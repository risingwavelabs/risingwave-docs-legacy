:::caution Experimental feature
The `SET BACKGROUND_DDL` command is currently an experimental feature. Its functionality is subject to change. We cannot guarantee its continued support in future releases, and it may be discontinued without notice. You may use this feature at your own risk.

Currently, if the cluster crashes while a background DDL operation is still running, recovery is not supported.
:::

Use the `SET BACKGROUND_DDL` command to run Data Definition Language (DDL) operations, such as creating materialized views in the background.

## Syntax

```sql
SET BACKGROUND_DDL = { true | false };
```

- When `BACKGROUND_DDL` is set to true, any subsequent DDL operations will be executed in the background, allowing you to proceed with other tasks. 

- When `BACKGROUND_DDL` is set to false (or not set at all), the DDL operations will execute as normal.

## Supported DDL operations

- [CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW](/sql/commands/sql-create-mv.md)

## Background management

### Monitor progress

You can monitor the progress of background DDL operations using the [`SHOW JOBS`](/sql/commands/sql-show-jobs.md) command.

### Cancel jobs

Running jobs in the background can be cancelled using the [`CANCEL JOBS`](/sql/commands/sql-cancel-jobs.md) command followed by the job ID.

### Set concurrent jobs

The maximum number of concurrent creating streaming jobs can be adjusted using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET max_concurrent_creating_streaming_jobs` command.

For example, you can set the maximum concurrent creating streaming jobs to 4:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_concurrent_creating_streaming_jobs TO 4;
```

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (v1 int);

INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000000);

SET BACKGROUND_DDL=true;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW m AS SELECT * FROM t; 
-- The "CREATE_MATERIALIZED_VIEW" response will be returned immediately.
```
