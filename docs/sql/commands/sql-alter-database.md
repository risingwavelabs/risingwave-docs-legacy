Use the `ALTER DATABASE` command to do the following operations on a databaseï¼š

+ change the owner

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name 
    alter_option;
```

*`alter_option`* depends on the operation you want to perform on the database.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name
    OWNER TO new_user
```
