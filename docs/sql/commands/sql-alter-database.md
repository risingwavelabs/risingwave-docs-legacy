The `ALTER DATABASE` command modifies the definition of a database.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name 
    alter_option;
```

*`alter_option`* depends on the operation you want to perform on the database. For all supported clauses, see the sections below.


## Clause

### `OWNER TO`

```sql title=Syntax
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name
    OWNER TO new_user;
```

|Parameter or clause        | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**OWNER TO**|This clause changes the owner of the database.|
|*new_user*|The new owner you want to assign to the database.|

```sql title=Example
-- Change the owner of the database named "database1" to user "user1"
ALTER DATABASE database1 OWNER TO user1;
```

:::note 
To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and you must have the `CREATEDB` privilege. Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.
:::

### `RENAME TO`

```sql title=Syntax
ALTER DATABASE current_database_name
    RENAME TO new_name;
```

|Parameter or clause        | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**RENAME TO**|This clause change the name of the database.|
|*new_name*|The new name of the database.|

```sql title=Example
-- Change the name of the database named "database" to "database1"
ALTER DATABASE database RENAME TO database1;
```

:::note 
Only the database owner or a superuser can rename a database; non-superuser owners must also have the `CREATEDB` privilege. The current database cannot be renamed. (Connect to a different database if you need to do that.)
