You can define your own functions (including table functions) and call these functions in RisingWave. With the user-defined function (UDF), you can tailor RisingWave to your needs and take advantage of the power and flexibility of Python and Java to perform complex and customized data processing and analysis tasks.
Currently, RisingWave supports UDFs implemented as external functions.

:::note Beta feature
UDF is currently in Beta. Please contact us if you encounter any issues or have feedback.
:::

RisingWave supports creating UDFs with the following programming languages:

- [Python](/sql/udf/udf-python.md)

- [Java](/sql/udf/udf-java.md)

You may also use UDFs to query data stored in different databases

- [Query foreign data](/sql/udf/udf-foreign-data.md)
