title: Use UDFs to query foreign data
description: Query data stored in other databases via UDFs
---

This article provides an example on how to query data stored in a different database via RisingWave. In this example we are using Python to query a Postgres database, but the same principles apply for other languages and databases.

To query foreign data via UDFs, you will need to create a UDF for each table you wish to query.

## Notes on performance

Querying foreign data is not efficient, since RisingWave will call a UDF server, which itself has to establish a connection against the foreign database. If performance is a concern, it is recommended to 

1. Stream changes from this database using CDC, if the data changes frequently

1. Load the entire database table into RisingWave, if the data does not change frequently



## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or later) installed on your computer.
  
- Ensure that you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and running. 

- Ensure that you have the [psql cli](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) available. 

- Ensure that you have [started and connected to RisingWave](get-started.md#run-risingwave).


## 1. UDF setup

Run the following command to download and install the RisingWave UDF API package and its dependencies.

```shell
pip install risingwave
```

<summary>How?</summary>
Here are a few methods for creating a Python file.
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code" label="Code editor">
Here we take VS Code as an example.

1. Open VS Code and create a new file by selecting **File** from the top menu and clicking on **New File**.

1. Type `udf.py` as the name and extension of the file.

1. Copy and paste the script below into the newly created file.

1. Save the edits.

<TabItem value="terminal" label="Terminal">
Here we take the Vim text editor as an example.

1. Open a terminal window.

1. Run `vim udf.py` to create the file and open it in Vim.

1. Press `I` to enter insert mode in Vim.

1. Copy and paste the script below into the editor.

1. Press `Esc` to exit insert mode.

1. Enter `:wq` to save the file and exit Vim.

```python title="udf.py"
from risingwave.udf import udf, udtf, UdfServer
import psycopg2

@udtf(input_types=['VARCHAR'], result_types=['INT', 'INT', 'VARCHAR'])
def select_people_table_pg(query):
    connection = None
    people_records = []
    try:
        connection = psycopg2.connect(user="postgres", # It is recommended to use a read-only user in production
                                      password="mysecretpassword", # Please do NOT hardcode your password in production!
                                      host="127.0.0.1",
                                      port="5432",
                                      database="people")

        cursor = connection.cursor()
        postgres_select_query = query
        cursor.execute(postgres_select_query)
        print("Selecting rows from people table using cursor.fetchall")
        people_records = cursor.fetchall()

    # UDF server will show errors
    except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
        print("Error while fetching data from PostgreSQL", error)

    finally:
        # closing database connection.
        if connection is not None:
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
            print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
    
    # return all result tuples
    for row in people_records:
        yield row


# Start a UDF server
if __name__ == '__main__':
    server = UdfServer(location="0.0.0.0:8815")
    server.add_function(select_people_table_pg)
    server.serve()
```

<summary>See code explanation</summary>

We use the `udtf` decorator to declare a UDF that returns multiple tuples at once. We pass the query string to `select_people_table_pg` as the parameter `query`. The query is executed in against a postgres server running on `127.0.0.1:5432`

</details>

After creating `udf.py`, start the UDF server.

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where `udf.py` is saved.

1. Run this command to execute `udf.py`.

    ```shell
    python3 udf.py
    ```

## 2. Postgres setup

To make this more fun, let's create data that our UDF can query. For this purpose we will run a local Postgres database using docker.

1. In a terminal run the following command: 

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -it -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres
    ```

1. Connect against the running postgres server in another terminal window 

    ```shell
    psql "port=5432 host=localhost user=postgres sslmode=disable" 
    ```

1. Create our example data by running below commands

    ```sql
    -- Create the database
    CREATE DATABASE people;

    -- Connect to the database
    \c people;

    -- Create the table
    CREATE TABLE people (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        age INT,
        name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    -- Insert 10 dummy rows
    INSERT INTO people (age, name) VALUES 
      (30, 'Neo'),
      (29, 'Trinity'),
      (44, 'Morpheus'),
      (NULL, 'Agent Smith'),  -- Assuming NULL for age as an AI program
      (35, 'Cypher'),
      (28, 'Tank'),
      (30, 'Dozer'),
      (27, 'Switch'),
      (22, 'Mouse'),
      (NULL, 'The Oracle');

    -- Verify the inserted data
    SELECT * FROM people; 
    ```

1. Exit the connection with postgres by typing `exit`. 

## 3. Declare your FUNCTION in RisingWave

In RisingWave, use the [`CREATE FUNCTION`](/sql/commands/sql-create-function.md) command to declare the functions you defined.

1. Connect against your local RisingWave server and type

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION select_people_table_pg(VARCHAR) RETURNS TABLE (id int, age int, name varchar) LANGUAGE python AS select_people_table_pg USING LINK 'http://localhost:8815'; -- If you are running RisingWave using Docker, replace the address with 'http://host.docker.internal:8815'.
```

## 4. Query the external data in Potsgres via RisingWave

Once the UDFs are created in RisingWave, you can use them in SQL queries to query external data from the `people` table, just like it would be stored in RisingWave.

```sql
select * from select_people_table_pg('SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 25;'::VARCHAR);
---
 id | age |   name
----+-----+----------
  1 |  30 | Neo
  2 |  29 | Trinity
  3 |  44 | Morpheus
  5 |  35 | Cypher
  6 |  28 | Tank
  7 |  30 | Dozer
  8 |  27 | Switch
(7 rows)
```

Please note that RisingWave will not show errors, but instead empty results, e.g. 

```sql
select * from select_people_table_pg('an invalid query;'::VARCHAR);
---
 id | age |   name
----+-----+----------
```
