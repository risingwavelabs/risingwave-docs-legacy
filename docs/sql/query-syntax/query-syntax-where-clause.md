---

The WHERE clause specifies any conditions or filters to apply to your data. This allows you to select only a specific subset of the data. Logically the WHERE clause is used right after the FROM clause.

Here is the basic syntax of a SELECT statement with the optional WHERE clause:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
```

Here, `condition` is any expression that evaluates to a result of type boolean. Any row that does not satisfy this condition will be removed from the output. A row satisfies the condition if it returns true when the actual row values are substituted for any variable references.

Basic WHERE clause examples:

```sql
-- select all rows that have id equal to 5
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE id=5;
-- select all rows that match the given case-insensitive LIKE expression
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE name ILIKE '%rise%';
-- select all rows that match the given composite expression
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE id=2 OR id=3;
```
