You can deliver data in RisingWave to external systems such as databases via Kafka topics. As RisingWave can act as a data source, you can connect RisingWave to various business intelligence tools to analyze and visualize the data.

Before you can write data from RisingWave to Kafka topics, you need to create a sink. A sink is an external target where you can send the processed data. Creating a sink connector establishes a connection with the target. You can create a sink by using the `CREATE SINK` statement. 

To learn about the syntax and parameters, see [CREATE SINK](../docs/sql/commands/sql-create-sink.md).

To see how you can connect RisingWave to Superset, see [Integration with Apache Superset](../docs/superset-integration.md).
