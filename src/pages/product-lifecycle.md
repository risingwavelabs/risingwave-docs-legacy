This page lists RisingWave's product release lifecycle and how RisingWave defines each stage.

## Technical preview

The technical preview stage is where we release a new feature for testing and feedback. It's not fully polished or finalized and is subject to change. We cannot guarantee its continued support in future releases, and it may be discontinued without notice. You may use this feature at your own risk.

## Beta

The beta stage is where we've incorporated feedback from the technical preview and are nearing the final product. It's more stable than the technical preview, but there may still be some bugs and issues.

## Generally available

All other features are considered to be generally available (GA). The generally available stage is where the feature is fully developed, tested, and ready for use in production environments. It's the most stable version of our feature.
