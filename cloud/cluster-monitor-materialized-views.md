You can view all [materialized views](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/key-concepts/#materialized-views) defined in the databases of a cluster.

1. Go to the [cluster details page](cluster-check-status-and-metrics.md#check-cluster-details).

2. Select the **Materialized Views** tab.

    <img
    src={require('./images/cluster-details-mv.png').default}
    alt="Materilized Views in cluster details"
    />
    
3. Click on a materialized view to see the details.

    You can view the direct acyclic graph of streaming executors for maintaining the materialized view. 

    <img
    src={require('./images/mv-graph.png').default}
    alt="Direct acyclic graph"
    />

4. You can click **< \> SQL** to see the query defined in the materialized view (i.e. the `AS` clause).

    <img
    src={require('./images/mv-graph-sql.png').default}
    alt="SQL details of a materialized view"
    />
