You can manage your payment methods for your organization in RisingWave Cloud. The saved payment methods will be used to make automatic payments of the monthly bill after each billing period. You can also use the saved payment methods to settle outstanding payments manually if the automatic payment fails.

- Currently, RisingWave Cloud only supports credit cards as the payment method.
