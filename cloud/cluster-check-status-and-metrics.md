You can check and monitor your clusters' overall running status and detailed metrics.

## Check all clusters

To browse each cluster's configuration and running status in your account, go to [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/).

In **Clusters**, you can see all the clusters in your account and [control their running states](cluster-stop-and-delete-clusters.md). You can also check the current plan, RisingWave Database version, region, and creation time of each cluster here.

## Check cluster details

To enter the cluster details page and check the information, such as current activities and resource usage, and monitor all metrics of a cluster, go to [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/) and click on the cluster.

The cluster details page includes:

- Current activities
- Resource metrics â€” CPU usage, memory usage, throughput, storage usage, and network
- Cluster configuration
- [Materialized views](cluster-monitor-materialized-views.md)
- [Database users](cluster-manage-database-users.md)
