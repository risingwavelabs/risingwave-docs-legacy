You need to create a sink in the database to deliver processed data to an external target. After a source is connected, you can create materialized views to perform analysis or sinks for data transformations.

For the complete list of supported sink connectors and data formats, see [Data delivery](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/data-delivery/) in the RisingWave documentation.

You can create a sink with one of the following methods:

- [Use guided setup](#using-guided-setup) on the **Sink** page
- [Write SQL command](#using-sql-command) manually

## Using guided setup

1. Go to [**Sink**](https://cloud.risingwave.com/sink/).

2. Specify the cluster and database, and log in as a database user.

    />

3. Click **Create sink**.

4. Select the service you want to connect to.

    :::note
    More services will be supported in future releases.
    :::

5. Configure the connector settings in the **Create sink** tab.

6. Configure the data settings in the **Sink details** tab.

  **Sink from**: You can sink data from a custom SQL query or an existing table / materialized view.

  **Format**: For details on data format, see [Data delivery](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/data-delivery/).
  
7. Check the generated SQL statement and click **Confirm** to create the sink in your database.
