## What is a cluster?

A cluster in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a cluster, you can create and manage database users and databases.

## What is a database user?

In RisingWave, a database user is similar to a database user or role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a cluster. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges.

## What are the differences between the free-tier plan and customized plans for invited users?

The free-tier plan offers all the essential resources to operate a RisingWave, but there is a seven-day limit on its lifespan. In contrast, the customized plan provides more flexibility in configuring the resources to meet your specific requirements and has no lifespan limit.

## Can I change the cluster plan?

You cannot change the plan of a cluster after creating it. You can create a new cluster with the desired plan.

## What to do if my free cluster expired?

Your data will be kept for an additional seven days. If you want to get a backup of your data, please contact us at cloud-support@risingwave-labs.com.
