## What is a cluster?

A cluster in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a cluster, you can create and manage database users and databases.

## What is a database user?

In RisingWave Database, a database user is similar to a database user or role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a cluster. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges.

## What are the differences between the free-tier plan and customized plans for invited users?

The free-tier plan offers all the essential resources to operate a RisingWave Database, but there is a five-day limit on its lifespan. After this period, your data will be deleted. In contrast, the customized plan provides more flexibility in configuring the resources to meet your specific requirements and has no lifespan limit.

## Can I change the cluster plan?

You cannot change the plan of a cluster after creating it. You can create a new cluster with the desired plan.
