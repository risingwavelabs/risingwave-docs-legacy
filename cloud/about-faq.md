## What is a project?

A project in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a project, you can create and manage database users and databases.

## What is a database user?

In RisingWave, a database user is similar to a database user or role in Postgres, allowing a person or application to access a specific database or set of databases within a project. Database users can be assigned specific permissions to control their database privileges.

## Can I change the project plan?

You cannot change the plan of a project after creating it. You can create a new project with the desired plan.

## What to do if my free project expires?

Your data will be kept for an additional seven days. If you want to get a backup of your data, please contact our [support team](mailto:cloud-support@risingwave-labs.com).

## Can I share my project with others?

Yes. You can invite others to join your organization and share your projects and other resources with them. See [Organization](/organization-overview.md) for more information.
