A cluster is a dedicated RisingWave cluster with its own set of components, such as compute nodes, frontend nodes, a meta server, and etcd service, along with computing and storage resources. Within a cluster, you can create and manage database users and databases.

> Currently, access to a cluster is restricted to one RisingWave Cloud account and cannot be shared among multiple accounts. Future releases will introduce organizational support, allowing for managing multiple accounts and their access to individual RisingWave clusters.
