<TabItem value="2" label="2. Create a cluster">

## Create a cluster

A cluster in RisingWave Cloud provides the necessary resources for hosting independent data repositories and streaming pipelines. Within a cluster, you can create and manage database users and databases.

You can find the **Create cluster** button on the [home page](https://risingwave.cloud/dashboard/) or the [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/) tab after your first login.
<p></p>

You can choose to create a free cluster or a customizable cluster if you have an invitation code.

See [Choose a cluster plan](cluster-choose-a-cluster-plan.md) for details on how to choose a cluster plan and configure the resources.

<TabItem value="3" label="3. Connect to your cluster">

## Connect to your cluster

After getting a cluster up and running, you need to connect to it so that you can interact with RisingWave Database.

You can choose from the following two ways to connect to your cluster.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="console" label="Query console">

The query console is the most intuitive and easy way to connect to and interact with RisingWave Database, offering graphical tools for managing data and visualizing results.


#### To connect via the console:


1. Go to [**Query**](https://risingwave.cloud/console/).  

2. Create a new database user.

    > You must log in to the cluster as a database user. Since this is a new cluster, you need to create a user in it first.

    <img

    alt="Create a database user"
    />

3. Enter the password of the user you created to log in to the cluster.

    alt="First login to the console"
    />

</TabItem>
 
<TabItem value="local" label="Local client">

For terminal enthusiasts, you can still connect to your cluster through a local terminal with the help of `psql`.

#### To connect via `psql` client:

1. [Install `psql`](https://www.risingwave.dev/docs/current/install-psql-without-postgresql/) in your environment.

    `psql` is a command-line interface for interacting with PostgreSQL databases, including RisingWave Database.

2. In RisingWave Cloud, go to [**Clusters**](https://risingwave.cloud/clusters/).
    
3. Click **Connect** of your cluster.

4. Create a new database user.
    
    > You must connect and log in to the cluster as a database user. Since this is a new cluster, you need to create a user in it first.

    alt="Create a database user in a cluster"
    />
    
5. Copy the connection string and run it in a terminal window.
    
6. Log in with the password of the database user.

## Explore RisingWave with examples

You can kickstart your journey with RisingWave Database by exploring the sample queries in the [**Query**](https://risingwave.cloud/console/) console.

These demos cover the most common steps in using RisingWave Database, such as establishing a connection with a data source, processing data by defining materialized views, and querying the results.
