The `ALTER SOURCE` command modifies the definition of a source.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SOURCE current_source_name
    alter_option;
```

*`alter_option`* depends on the operation you want to perform on the source. For all supported clauses, see the sections below.

## Clause

### `ADD COLUMN`

```sql title=Syntax
ALTER SOURCE source_name
    ADD COLUMN col_name data_type;
```

|Parameter or clause        | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**ADD COLUMN** |This clause adds a column to the specified source.|
|*col_name* | The name of the new column you want to add to the source.|
|*data_type* | The data type of the newly added column. With the struct data type, you can create a nested table. Elements in a nested table need to be enclosed with angle brackets (`<>`).|

```sql title=Example
-- Add a column named "v3" to a source named "src1"
ALTER SOURCE src1
    ADD COLUMN v3 int;
```

:::note

+ If your source is created with a schema registry, columns cannot be altered.

+ You cannot add a primary key column to a source or table in RisingWave. To modify the primary key of a source or table, you need to recreate the table.

+ You cannot remove a column from a source in RisingWave. If you intend to remove a column from a source, you'll need to drop the source and create the source again.
