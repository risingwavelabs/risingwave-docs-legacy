You can ingest data from NATS JetStream into RisingWave by using the NATS source connector in RisingWave.

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is an open source messaging system for cloud native applications. It provides a lightweight publish-subscribe architecture for high performance messaging.

[NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) is a streaming data platform built on top of NATS. It enables real-time and historical access to streams of data via durable subscriptions and consumer groups.

:::caution Experimental Feature
The NATS source connector in RisingWave is currently an experimental feature, and its functionality is subject to change. We cannot guarantee its continued support in future releases, and it may be discontinued without notice. You may use this feature at your own risk.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before ingesting data from NATS JetStream into RisingWave, please ensure the following:

- The NATS JetStream server is running and accessible from your RisingWave cluster.
- If authentication is required for the NATS JetStream server, make sure you have the client username and password. The client user must have the `subscribe` permission for the subject.
- Create the NATS subject from which you want to ingest data.
- Ensure that your RisingWave cluster is running.

## Ingest data into RisingWave

When creating a source, you can choose to persist the data from the source in RisingWave by using `CREATE TABLE` instead of `CREATE SOURCE` and specifying the connection settings and data format.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE {TABLE | SOURCE} [ IF NOT EXISTS ] source_name 
[ schema_definition ]
WITH (
   connector='nats',
   nats.server_url='<your nats server>:<port>', [ <another_server_url_if_available>, ...]
   nats.subject='<your subject>',

   -- Optional parameters
   nats.user='<your user name>',
   nats.password='<your password>'
)
FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```

**schema_definition**:

```sql
(
   column_name data_type [ PRIMARY KEY ], ...
   [ PRIMARY KEY ( column_name, ... ) ]
)
```

:::note

RisingWave performs primary key constraint checks on tables with connector settings but not on regular sources. If you need the checks to be performed, please create a table with connector settings.

For a table with primary key constraints, if a new data record with an existing key comes in, the new record will overwrite the existing record.

:::note

According to the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/jetstream_admin/naming), stream names must adhere to subject naming rules as well as being friendly to the file system. Here are the recommended guidelines for stream names:

* Use alphanumeric values.
* Avoid spaces, tabs, periods (`.`), greater than (`>`) or asterisks (`*`).
* Do not include path separators (forward slash or backward slash).
* Keep the name length limited to 32 characters as the JetStream storage directories include the account, stream name, and consumer name.
* Avoid using reserved file names like `NUL` or `LPT1`.
* Be cautious of case sensitivity in file systems. To prevent collisions, ensure that stream or account names do not clash due to case differences. For example, `Foo` and `foo` would collide on Windows or macOS systems.

### Parameters

|Field|Notes|
|---|---|
|nats.server_url| Required. URLs of the NATS JetStream server, in the format of *address*:*port*. If multiple addresses are specified, use commas to separate them.|
|nats.subject| Required. NATS subject that you want to ingest from.|
|nats.user| Optional. If authentication is required, specify the client user name.|
|nats.password| Optinal. If authentication is required, specify the client password.|

## What's next

After the source or table is created, you can create materialized views to transform or analyze your streaming data.
