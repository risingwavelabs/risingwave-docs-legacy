### Install RisingWave with Homebrew

Start a RisingWave standalone instance in your local environment with Homebrew.

:::caution
This method starts RisingWave in playground mode, where data is temporarily stored in memory. The service automatically terminates after 30 minutes of inactivity, causing all data to be lost.
To persist your data, use the [RisingWave Kubernetes Operator](/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes.md) or [RisingWave Cloud](/docs/deploy/risingwave-cloud.md).
:::

1. ### Install and start RisingWave

  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run the following commands.

  ```shell
  brew tap risingwavelabs/risingwave # Tap the repository
  brew install risingwave # Install the latest release of RisingWave. Replace with `brew install risingwave --HEAD` if you want to install the latest development version of RisingWave.
  risingwave playground # Start RisingWave in playground mode
  ```

1. ### Connect to RisingWave

  After RisingWave is up and running, you need to connect to it via the Postgres interactive terminal `psql` so that you can issue queries to RisingWave and see the query results. If you don't have `psql` installed, [Install `psql`](/guides/install-psql-without-full-postgres.md) first.

  Open a new terminal window and run:

  ```shell
  psql -h localhost -p 4566 -d dev -U root
  ```

Notes about the `psql` options:

- The `-h` option is used to specify the host name or IP address of the PostgreSQL server to connect to.
- The `-p` option is used to specify the port number that the server is listening on.
- The `-d` option is used to specify the name of the database to connect to.
- The `-U` option is used to specify the name of the database user to connect as.
- By default, the PostgreSQL server uses the `root user` account to authenticate connections to the `dev` database. Note that this user account does not require a password to connect.

- The `-U` option is used to specify the name of the database user to connect as.
- By default, the PostgreSQL server uses the `root user` account to authenticate connections to the `dev` database. Note that this user account does not require a password to connect.

1. ### Optional: Enable the connector node

  The RisingWave connector node is a separate Java component that allows RisingWave to be integrated with external systems. It can be used to consume CDC events and sink data to downstream databases.

  To enable the connector node:

    1. Navigate to where your `risingwave` directory is located and run `./risedev configure`.

    1. Enable the **[Build] Build RisingWave Connector (Java)** option.

    1. Uncomment `use connector-node` in the risedev.yml file like below.

    <img
    src={require('../images/uncomment-connector-node.png').default}
    alt="Edit risedev.yml file for connector node"
    />

  The connector node will now be enabled when you run RisingWave.

### Set up a local RisingWave cluster with Docker Compose

Use the pre-defined Docker Compose configuration file to set up a multi-node RisingWave cluster.

:::info

If you intend to deploy RisingWave in production environments, please use [RisingWave Cloud](/deploy/risingwave-cloud.md) or [the RisingWave Kubernetes Operator](/deploy/risingwave-kubernetes.md). This is because it has better support for resource management and we conduct comprehensive tests for it.
:::

The cluster is composed of multiple RisingWave components, including:

- A frontend node
- A compute node
- A meta node
- A compactor node
- A connector node

RisingWave also incorporates these third-party components:

- Grafana
- Etcd
- MinIO
- Prometheus

1. ### Download the source file and start a cluster

  As prerequisites, you need to install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in your environment. Ensure that it is running before launching the cluster.

  Then, clone the [risingwave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave) repository.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave.git
  ```

  Now run the following commands to navigate to the `docker` directory and start the cluster from the pre-defined docker-compose file.

  ```shell
  cd docker
  docker compose up -d
  ```

1. ### Connect to RisingWave

  After RisingWave is up and running, you need to connect to it via the Postgres interactive terminal `psql` so that you can issue queries to RisingWave and see the query results. If you don't have `psql` installed, [Install `psql`](/guides/install-psql-without-full-postgres.md) first.

  ```shell
  psql -h localhost -p 4566 -d dev -U root
  ```

  Notes about the `psql` options:

- The `-h` option is used to specify the host name or IP address of the PostgreSQL server to connect to.
- The `-p` option is used to specify the port number that the server is listening on.
- The `-d` option is used to specify the name of the database to connect to.
- The `-U` option is used to specify the name of the database user to connect as.
