You can define your own functions (including table functions) and call these functions in RisingWave. With the user-defined function (UDF), you can tailor RisingWave to your needs and take advantage of the power and flexibility of Python to perform complex and customized data processing and analysis tasks.

See [User defined functions](/sql/functions-operators/user-defined-functions.md) for details.
