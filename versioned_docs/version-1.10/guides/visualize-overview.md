You can use a variety of reporting tools, such as [Apache Superset](/guides/superset-integration.md) or [Grafana](/guides/grafana-integration.md) to query and visualize data in RisingWave.

If the reporting tool you are using is not listed in the official RisingWave documentation, you may attempt to connect to RisingWave directly using the PostgreSQL driver. You can let us know your interest in a particular system by clicking the thumb-up button on [Integrations](/rw-integration-summary.md).
