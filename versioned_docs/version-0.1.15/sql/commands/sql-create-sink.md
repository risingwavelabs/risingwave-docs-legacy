Use the `CREATE SINK` command to create a sink. A sink is an external target where you can send data processed in RisingWave. You can create a sink from a materialized source, a materialized view, or a table.


## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SINK [ IF NOT EXISTS ] sink_name 
FROM sink_from
WITH (
   connector='kafka',
   properties.bootstrap.server='broker_address',
   topic='topic_address',
   format='format'
);
```

## Parameters

All WITH options are required.

|Parameter | Description|
|---|---|
|sink_name| Name of the sink to be created|
|sink_from| The source from which data will be output. It can be a materialized source, a materialized view, or a table.|
|connector| Sink type. Currently, only `‘kafka’` is supported.|
|properties.bootstrap.server|Address of the Kafka broker. Format: `‘ip:port’`. If there are multiple brokers, separate them with commas. |
|topic|Address of the Kafka topic. One sink can only correspond to one topic.|
|format	| Data format. Allowed formats: `‘append-only’`, `‘debezium’`.|



:::note

Names and unquoted identifiers are case-insensitive. Therefore, you must double-quote any of these fields for them to be case-sensitive.
