# Important note

This repository will serve as an archive for RisingWave user documentation up to version 2.0. The topics are published to the [legacy documentation site](https://legacy-docs.risingwave-labs.com/docs/current/intro/).

The latest documentation source files are in the [`risingwave-docs` repository](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-docs) for our documentation source files. This change reflects a shift in our documentation infrastructure.

# Contribute to RisingWave user docs

For issues and documentation contribution, please go to the [the `risingwave-docs` repository](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-docs).
